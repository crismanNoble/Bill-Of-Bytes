Bill-Of-Bytes
=============

The Bill of Rights, in a machine readable format.

I was asked if it was possible to read the real Bill of Rights without visiting DC. I found them on Project Gutenberg and decided to make them into digital artifacts. I made this while learning javscript, exerimenting with QR codes, pushing the limits of dropbox based hosting (since moved to github pages), and learning a bit about Creative Commons.
